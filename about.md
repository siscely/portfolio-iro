I am a full stack web developer with knowledge in both front end and back end languages, responsive frameworks, and best code practices.  My objective is to be a confident web developer.  I am dedicated to learning from seasoned web developers, remaining humble, while continuing to stride to be good at development.  While a student of Engineering at Bangalore University, India, I studied Mathematics and, I believe, my analytical and problem solving skills are skills that has and will continue to contribute to my overall success as a developer.
