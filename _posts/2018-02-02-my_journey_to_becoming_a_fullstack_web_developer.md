title: My journey to becoming a full stack Developer
---
The great ingenuity involved in software development has always intrigued me, and I want to be a part of it. I have always been passionate about this and wanted it very badly. My research online led me to Bloc, whose review on Course Report and SwitchUp were excellent.  I enrolled into their 'online web development appretinceship', the journey started and since then there was no turning back, as I knew this is what I wanted to do.

The journey with Bloc has been nothing less than that, an inner peace and joy.  I would rate their curriculum as excellent.  I was blessed to have wonderful mentors with whom I had two one-on-one meetings every week.  They were always there, just an e-mail away, to help me through the course.  My backend mentor had 30+ years web development experience and came with vast knowledge from whom I learnt quite a bit.

Bloc curriculum also helped me understand how prepared I have to be for job interviews.  They conducted assessments at the end of Modules, which I took very seriously, reviewed my course work thoroughly to be ready for the assessment and passed all 3 assessments.  They had these small videos in between the curriculum to boost our morale and to keep us encouraged through the curriculum, which helped me stay focused, committed, and disciplined.  These videos always brought a smile on my face.  It showed how much Bloc cared for their students to reach their goal.

I know for sure that working in web development will not feel like work as I enjoy being part of it.  My goal is to be a better and a confident javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails programmer, and would like to learn React eventually.
